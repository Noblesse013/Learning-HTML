<!-- There are two types of list in html. They are as follow: 
<ul> Unordered lists
<ol> Ordered lists
-->

<!--
Use the <ul> tag at the beginning of unordered lists, sometimes called bullet points, 
and wrap each item in a <li> list item element. As such:
-->
<ul>
  <li>ğŸ§º Go to University.</li>
  <li>ğŸ–¥ Code for 45 min.</li>
  <li>ğŸ’… Take a bubble bath.</li>
</ul>

<!-- 
For ordered list, we use <ol> and it does the numbering for us.
-->
<ol>
  <li>ğŸ§º Go to University.</li>
  <li>ğŸ–¥ Code for 45 min.</li>
  <li>ğŸ’… Take a bubble bath.</li>
</ol>
