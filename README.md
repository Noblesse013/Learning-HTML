# Learning-HTML

Here are some must-haves in a .html file!

The <!DOCTYPE html> is the document type declaration that appears at the top of a .html file and tells the browser that our file is written in HTML5. This is used with a <html> element containing all the code processed on the page.

Notice how the <!DOCTYPE html> doesnâ€™t have a closing tag, while <html> does. The output looks like this! And please do check the raw code for better understanding.
