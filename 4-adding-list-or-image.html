<img src="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/97/58/97/360_F_97589769_t45CqXyzjz0KXwoBZT9PRaWGHRk5hQqQ.jpg">

<!-- And to add a link in webpage , we use anchor element. Here 'href' means hyperlink reference, is a reference or pointer to another website that is linked in our HTML.
-->
<a href="https://archive.org/web">Internet Archive</a>
